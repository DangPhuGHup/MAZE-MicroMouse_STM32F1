# Maze-Solving MicroMouse Using STM32F103C8T6

## üê≠ Project Overview

This project implements a **maze-solving robot** (MicroMouse) using the **STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller**. The robot navigates a maze by reading distances via the **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor**, calculating the optimal movement with a **PID controller**, and controlling its **N20 motors** through the **TB6612 motor driver**. The system is designed for precision, efficiency, and adaptability in solving mazes.
